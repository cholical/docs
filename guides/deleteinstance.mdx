### Intro
Stopping Instances helps save money on GPU deployments when you're not using them. The Shadeform API enables programmatically stopping instances, which saves money and enables new use cases.

### Setup
Let's assume that you have a Shadeform API key from [here](https://platform.shadeform.ai/settings/api), 
and an active instance. If you need an active instance, then 
[this guide](/guides/mostaffordablegpus) will help you get set up.

### Deleting an instance:

Using the API, let's list our active instances:
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
base_url = "https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances"
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "<api-key>", 
    "Content-Type" : "application/json"
}
instance_response = requests.request("GET", base_url, headers=headers)
print(instance_response)
```
```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'
```
</CodeGroup>


To delete this instance, we'll use the ID of the instance that we want to delete to make a delete request. 
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
instances = json.loads(instance_response.text)['instances']
# We will specifically be looking to stop the first instance in the list.
# Note that this requires at least one active instance
instance_id = instances[0]['id']
delete_url = base_url + '/' + instance_id + '/delete'
delete_response = requests.request("POST", delete_url, headers=headers)
print(delete_response)
```

```bash cURL
# Copy the instance id from above that you'd like to stop/delete
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances/{id}/delete \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'

```
</CodeGroup>

Just like that, we've stopped a running instance. While we had a human in the loop, this can all be done without human involvement once compute jobs are finished.

### Next Steps:
We alluded to the fact that stopping instances enables new use cases. Be on the lookout as we showcase some of these here ðŸ‘€.
