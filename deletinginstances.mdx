title: 'Deleting/Stopping GPU Instances'
---
### Background
Stopping Instances helps save money on GPU deployments when you're not using them. Stopping them via the UI requires a human in the loop to stop the GPU's. But with the API, users can stop them themselves or programmatically.

### Setup
Let's assume that you have a Shadeform API key from [here](https://platform.shadeform.ai/settings/api), 
and an active instance. If you need an active instance, then 
[this](https://docs.shadeform.ai/findingmostaffordablegpus) will help you.

### Deleting an instance:

Using the API, let's list our active instances
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
base_url = "https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances"
headers = {
    "X-API-KEY": "<api-key>", 
    "Content-Type" : "application/json"
}
instance_response = requests.request("GET", base_url, headers=headers)
print(instance_response)
```
```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'
```
</CodeGroup>


To Delete this instance, we'll use the ID of the instance that we want to delete to make a delete request
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
instances = json.loads(instance_response.text)['instances']
# We will specifically be looking to stop the first instance in the list.
# Note that this requires an active instance
instance_id = instances[0]['id']
delete_url = base_url + '/' + instance_id + '/delete'
delete_response = requests.request("POST", delete_url, headers=headers)
print(delete_response)
```

```bash cURL
# Copy the instance id from above that you'd like to stop/delete
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.shadeform.ai/v1/instances/{id}/delete \
  --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'

```
</CodeGroup>
